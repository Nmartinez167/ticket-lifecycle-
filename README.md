<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<li>Project Summary
This phase of the osTicket implementation focused on showcasing the end-to-end workflow of a support ticket. It highlights how osTicket is used to intake, triage, prioritize, and resolve user issues in a structured, SLA-compliant environment. By leveraging osTicketâ€™s built-in tools, I helped optimize the ticketing process to reduce resolution times and enhance support team responsiveness.</li>

Ticket Lifecycle Stages
Ticket Creation (Intake): 
 <li>Tickets are initiated by users or agents via the web portal or email.

 <li>Each ticket captures essential information to categorize and route the issue effectively.</li>

 <li>Assignment & Initial Communication:</li>

 <li>Tickets are automatically assigned to appropriate departments or agents.</li>

 <li>The support agent initiates contact with the user, confirms details, and sets expectations.</li>

Issue Resolution Process:<img width="1182" height="738" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-15 125741" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fcc3225-5484-4a8f-af4a-77eb2e475dad" />


 <li>Agents investigate and troubleshoot the issue, providing progress updates as needed.</li>

 <li>Collaboration or escalation is initiated if the issue requires specialized support.</li>

Resolution & Closure:

 <li>Once the issue is resolved, the agent confirms resolution with the user.</li>

 <li>The ticket is then closed, with all actions and communications logged for future reference.</li>

SLA-Driven Ticket Prioritization
 <li>To ensure time-sensitive issues are addressed appropriately, tickets were prioritized using SLAs based on severity:</li>

 <li>Sev-A | Critical (1 Hour, 24/7):
For high-impact incidents (e.g., full system outages such as mobile or online banking downtime). Immediate escalation to the SysAdmins team with a 1-hour resolution window.</li>

 <li>Sev-B | High (2 Hours, 24/7):
For important but non-critical issues (e.g., urgent software requests like Adobe for accounting). Resolved within 2 hours, available around the clock.</li>

 <li>Sev-C | Moderate (4 Hours, Business Hours):
For lower-priority issues (e.g., system slowness on executive workstations). Addressed during business hours with a 4-hour resolution window.</li>

 <li>This SLA framework helped ensure a balance between urgent resolutions and routine support tasks, improving overall help desk performance and accountability.</li>

Ticket Triage & Escalation
<li>Assessed incoming tickets to determine resolution path.</li>

<li>Escalated tickets to specialized teams (e.g., Level II or SysAdmins) based on complexity or urgency.</li>

<li>Ensured no ticket was delayed due to misrouting or lack of clarity.</li>

Resolution & Documentation
<li>Delivered timely solutions while maintaining clear, professional communication with users.</li>

<li>Verified issue resolution before closing each ticket.</li>

Ensured accurate documentation for auditing, trend analysis, and knowledge base updates.

Outcome
<li>By managing the complete lifecycle of support tickets within osTicket, I contributed to a responsive, SLA-compliant support environment. This process improved issue tracking, reduced response times, and increased user satisfaction through timely, well-documented resolutions.</li>
